 Title :  A Novel Hybrid Approach for Secure Image Encryption: Leveraging Chaotic Maps and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

 Abstract: Due to the proliferation of smart devices and high-speed internet, the volume of digital images has surged in recent years, necessitating robust encryption techniques to ensure their integrity. This paper introduces a novel hybrid encryption approach that integrates chaotic maps with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for secure image encryption. The proposed method processes 8,000 color images of varying sizes, resizing them to 128 Ã— 128 pixels for consistent  encryption and decryption. Highly secure keys generated by chaotic maps are used to encrypt and decrypt
the images. A CNN model is then trained on the original, encrypted, and decrypted images, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 98.56% after 100 epochs. Statistical analysis reveals excellent security metrics, with NPCR at 99.65%, UACI at 33.267%, and entropy at 7.989206. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively enhances image security without loss of information. The model is implemented and analyzed using Google Colab, showcasing its potential for safeguarding sensitive image data in various applications.
